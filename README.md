TWITTER BOOTSTRAP
=================

Bootstrap is Twitter's toolkit for kickstarting CSS for websites, apps, and more. It includes base CSS styles for typography, forms, buttons, tables, grids, navigation, alerts, and more.

This version has been ported to the awesome Stylus css language. The original version can be found here: http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap!


Developers
----------

We have included a makefile with convenience methods for working with the bootstrap library.

+ **build** - `make build`
This will run the stylus compiler on the bootstrap lib and generate a bootstrap.css and bootstrap.min.css file.
The stylus compiler is required for this command to run. (npm install -g stylus)
